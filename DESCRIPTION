Description: Implements the five-parameter Generalized Kumaraswamy ('gkw') 
    distribution proposed by 'Carrasco, Ferrari and Cordeiro (2010)' 
    <doi:10.48550/arXiv.1004.0911> and its seven nested sub-families for 
    modeling bounded continuous data on the unit interval (0,1). The 'gkw' 
    distribution extends the Kumaraswamy distribution described by Jones (2009) 
    <doi:10.1016/j.stamet.2008.04.001>. Provides density, distribution, 
    quantile, and random generation functions, along with analytical 
    log-likelihood, gradient, and Hessian functions implemented in 'C++' via 
    'RcppArmadillo' for maximum computational efficiency. Suitable for modeling 
    proportions, rates, percentages, and indices exhibiting complex features 
    such as asymmetry, or heavy tails and other shapes not adequately captured by 
    standard distributions like simple Beta or Kumaraswamy.
