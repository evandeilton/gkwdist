Description: Implements the five-parameter Generalized Kumaraswamy (GKw) 
    distribution and its seven nested sub-families for modeling bounded 
    continuous data on the unit interval (0,1). Provides density, distribution, 
    quantile, and random generation functions, along with analytical 
    log-likelihood, gradient, and Hessian functions implemented in 'C++' via 
    'RcppArmadillo' for maximum computational efficiency. Suitable for modeling 
    proportions, rates, percentages, and indices exhibiting complex features 
    such as bimodality, asymmetry, or heavy tails not adequately captured by 
    standard distributions like Beta or Kumaraswamy.
