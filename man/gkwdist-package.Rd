\title{gkwdist: Generalized Kumaraswamy Distribution Family}
\description{
Implements the five-parameter Generalized Kumaraswamy (GKw) distribution proposed by Carrasco, Ferrari and Cordeiro (2010) \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0911}{arXiv:1004.0911} and its seven nested sub-families for modeling bounded continuous data on the unit interval (0,1). The GKw distribution extends the Kumaraswamy distribution described by Jones (2009) \doi{10.1016/j.stamet.2008.04.001}. Provides density, distribution, quantile, and random generation functions, along with analytical log-likelihood, gradient, and Hessian functions implemented in 'C++' via 'RcppArmadillo' for maximum computational efficiency. Suitable for modeling proportions, rates, percentages, and indices exhibiting complex features such as bimodality, asymmetry, or heavy tails not adequately captured by standard distributions like Beta or Kumaraswamy.
